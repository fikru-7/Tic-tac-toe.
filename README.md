# Tic tac toe game
Tic Tac Toe ‚Äì Console Game in C++
This is a simple two-player Tic Tac Toe game developed in C++. It is played in the terminal using a 3√ó3 grid, and it demonstrates essential programming concepts including arrays, loops, input validation, and modular function design.

‚úÖ Features
ÔÇ∑3√ó3 game board using a 2D array
ÔÇ∑Turn-based play (Player X and Player O)
ÔÇ∑Input validation to avoid invalid or duplicate moves
ÔÇ∑Win and draw detection
ÔÇ∑Console UI with grid formatting
ÔÇ∑Modular code with functions for each game component
üéØ Objectives
ÔÇ∑Implement and manipulate 2D arrays
ÔÇ∑Create functions for repetitive tasks (board display, win checking, etc.)
ÔÇ∑Use loops and conditionals effectively
ÔÇ∑Perform robust input validation
ÔÇ∑Gain experience with console-based C++ applications
üéÆ How the Game Works
8.The game initializes a 3√ó3 empty board.
9.Player X goes first, followed by Player O.
10.Players enter their move as two numbers: row and column (values 0‚Äì2).
11.The game checks if the input is valid, if the space is taken, and if there's a win or draw.
12.The game ends when a player wins or the board is full (draw).
üõ† Technologies Used
ÔÇ∑Language: C++
ÔÇ∑Libraries: iostream, limits
ÔÇ∑IDE: Code::Blocks / Dev C++ / VS Code
ÔÇ∑Compiler: g++
ÔÇ∑Platform: Terminal / Console
‚ñ∂Ô∏è How to Compile and Run
Step 1: Compile the program
C++ tictactoe.cpp -o tictactoe
Step 2: Run the executable
./tictactoe       # Linux/Mac
tictactoe.exe     # Windows
Step 3: Play
- Input format: row column (e.g., 1 1 for center)
- Values must be between 0 and 2.
